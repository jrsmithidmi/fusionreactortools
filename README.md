How to paste text to column:

<ul>
<li>Copy all of your tab-delimited text. Tab-delimited text is a format for storing data from a spreadsheet as a text file.</li>
<li>Select the cell in Excel that you want to paste into. Select the upper-leftmost cell that you want your pasted data to appear in.</li>
<li>Paste the data. In newer versions of Excel, and if your data was properly delimited with tab stops, the cells should fill out appropriately with the correct data.</li>
<li>Select the entire column of data. If your tab-delimited data did not paste correctly, you can use Excel's Text to Columns tool to format it properly.</li>
<li>Open the Data tab and click "Text to Columns". You'll find this in the Data Tools group in the Data tab.</li>
<li>Select "Delimited" and click "Next". This will tell Excel that it will be looking for a specific character to mark cell divisions.</li>
<li>Select the character that your data is separated by. If your data is tab-delimited, check the "Tab" box and uncheck any other boxes.</li>
<li>Choose the format of the first column. After selecting your delimiter, you'll be able to set the data format for each of the columns that are being created.</li>
<li>Repeat for additional columns. Select each column in the frame at the bottom of the window and choose the format.</li>
<li>Finish the wizard. Once you have formatted each of the columns, click Finish to apply the new delimiter.</li>
</ul>
